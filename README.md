# PYTHON-PROJECT--SPACEHUB--pygame

This is a game made using the python module pygame, which consists of two elements namely a shooting spaceship and meteors, which you have to shoot using the rocket. 
However if the position of the rocket and the meteor happen to be the same, it ends in a collision and the game ends. 

Motivation behind the project :

It was designed as a time-killer game to fight boredom and anxiety. Got nothing to do ? Play a bit of SpaceHub, zone out in the game and have some time off without feeling
guilty !!!

How to  play the game ?

1. Install pygame using pip install pygame on your local device. (preferably v 2.1.2)
2. Clone and run the github repo on your local device and you are good to go.
